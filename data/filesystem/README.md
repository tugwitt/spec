# Filesystem

the filesystem is where we actually store the data. at the end of the day, most base data storage techniques are some 
variation of a filesystem.

this will most likely look like a heirarchical filesystem of [.at files](http://liegroups.org/software/documentation/atlasofliegroups-docs/tutorial/video_1A/basics.html#the-basic-at-file)
that represent the underlying definition of the Lie group representation of the given dataset.
