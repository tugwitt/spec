# Filesystem

the filesystem is where we actually store the data. at the end of the day, most base data storage techniques are some 
variation of a filesystem.

this will most likely look like a heirarchical filesystem of [.at files](http://liegroups.org/software/documentation/atlasofliegroups-docs/tutorial/video_1A/basics.html#the-basic-at-file)
that represent the underlying definition of the Lie group representation of the given dataset.

### SQL Server

SQL Server uses data files as it's core data storage mechanism. [SQL Server Internals](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sql/database-administration/sql-server-storage-internals-101/)

>  A record, also known as a row, is the smallest storage structure in a SQL Server data file. Each row in a table is stored as an individual record on disk. Not only table data is stored as records, but also indexes, metadata, database boot structures and so forth. However, weâ€™ll concentrate on only the most common and important record type, namely the data record, which shares the same format as the index record.
